# Intro
This sketch measures the voltage over a potentiometer and outputs that onto a four digit, seven segment display

# Requirements
requires the SevSeg.h library, unless you want to put yourself through hell /j

the circuit just requires the four digit, seven segment display, and a resistor on each of the digit pins.

there is great documentation/download link here:
